    I think you get the point. This is one of the biggest, most summer themed parties you will ever attend. If you get a ticket that is! They do sell fast (usually in minutes).
</p>
<p>
    Tickets go on sale on Thursday the 18th of May, and can be <a href="http://www.gathercontent.com">purchased via this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Don't be stupid, come to the Big Summer Party. Live a little!
</p>
<p>
    We'll be sending out an email and an article with full details about the party in the next few weeks. Watch that space!

    This is a chance to really earn your vegetable stripes. Colleen Anderson will be flying in from San Francisco with the sole intention of teaching you how to cook. With only vegetables. No wheat, no meat, no rice, and no spice. You'll be amazed at the flavours which come from this ancient cooking philosophy.
</p>
<p>
    This is a free members program event, so you'll have to be a member if you want to attend. <a href="http://www.gathercontent.com">Learn about TGEC Membership here</a>.

    The cooking will only take around 5 hours, and you don't need to bring anything with you in order to join in. Phone Reggie to book your place (<mark class="inline-comment" data-thread-id="f270257a-fd27-4bfa-926b-deedf2eb817b">07906767610909871</mark>).
